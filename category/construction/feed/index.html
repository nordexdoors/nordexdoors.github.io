<p>The 2030 Challenge is challenging us, the design community, to design energy efficient buildings to meet the following criteria: all new building, developments and major renovations shall be designed to meet a fossil fuel, GHG-emitting, energy consumption performance standard of 50% of the regional (or county) average of that building type.</p>
<p>The fossil fuel reduction standard for all new building shall be increased to:</p>
<p>60% in 2010</p>

<p>The ultimate goal is the Net Zero Building or a building that produces the same amount of energy in a year that the building consumes.</p>

<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&#8217;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<p>Our commitment to the environment that motivates us to build a home that not only reduces the impact but also brings about recovery. High performance design and advanced technology make building a home that produces as much energy as possible by renewable energy, called energyless energy. The report says 33% of net-zero units are built in the United States and Canada, up 15% from 2015. 8023 single homes and families will eliminate nearly 78,000 tons of CO2 per year compared to Building Compliance Compliance. That equates to 16,406 cars and motorcycles in the United States. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed et nisi id est suscipit dignissim a eget nibh. Nulla facilisi.
