<p>Control system of NZE in civil homes.</p>
<p>The 2030 Challenge is challenging us, the design community, to design energy efficient buildings to meet the following criteria: all new building, developments and major renovations shall be designed to meet a fossil fuel, GHG-emitting, energy consumption performance standard of 50% of the regional (or county) average of that building type.</p>
<p>The fossil fuel reduction standard for all new building shall be increased to:</p>
<p>60% in 2010</p>
<p>70% in 2015</p>
<p>80% in 2020</p>
<p>90% in 2025</p>
<p>Carbon-neutral in 2030</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is the Net Zero Building or a building that produces the same amount of energy in a year that the building consumes.</p>
