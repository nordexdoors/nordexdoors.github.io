								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our commitment to the environment that motivates us to build a home that not only reduces the impact but also brings about recovery. High performance design and advanced technology make building a home that produces as much energy as possible by renewable energy, called energyless energy. The report says 33% of net-zero units are built in the United States and Canada, up 15% from 2015. 8023 single homes and families will eliminate nearly 78,000 tons of CO2 per year compared to Building Compliance Compliance. That equates to 16,406 cars and motorcycles in the United States. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed et nisi id est suscipit dignissim a eget nibh. Nulla facilisi. Ut sagittis arcu et semper tempor. Morbi vitae risus neque. Orci varius natoque penatibus et magnis dis partu.</p>
<h5>Control system of NZE in civil homes.</h5>
<p>The 2030 Challenge is challenging us, the design community, to design energy efficient buildings to meet the following criteria: all new building, developments and major renovations shall be designed to meet a fossil fuel, GHG-emitting, energy consumption performance standard of 50% of the regional (or county) average of that building type.</p>
<p>The fossil fuel reduction standard for all new building shall be increased to:</p>
<p>60% in 2010</p>
<p>70% in 2015</p>
<p>80% in 2020</p>
<p>90% in 2025</p>
<p>Carbon-neutral in 2030</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is the Net Zero Building or a building that produces the same amount of energy in a year that the building consumes.</p>
