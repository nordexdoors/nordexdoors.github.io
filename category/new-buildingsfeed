<p>The 2030 Challenge is challenging us, the design community, to design energy efficient buildings to meet the following criteria: all new building, developments and major renovations shall be designed to meet a fossil fuel, GHG-emitting, energy consumption performance standard of 50% of the regional (or county) average of that building type.</p>
<p>The fossil fuel reduction standard for all new building shall be increased to:</p>
